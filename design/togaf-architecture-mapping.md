## 1. Purpose

This document describes the proposed approach for a new architecture initiative
using the **TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM)**.

It focuses on:

- the overall ADM workflow,
- the purpose of each phase,
- and the typical deliverables produced,

independent of any specific domain or solution content.

The objective is to provide a neutral basis for discussion with experts on:

- scope and ambition,
- governance and organisation,
- risks and success factors,
- and suitability of TOGAF for the initiative.

---

## 2. Why TOGAF

TOGAF is selected because it provides:

- a **structured, iterative method** for complex initiatives,
- clear separation between business, data, application, and technology concerns,
- strong emphasis on **governance and change management**,
- and a common language for architects, IT, and management.

The ADM supports:

- stakeholder alignment,
- controlled evolution,
- and traceability from drivers to implementation.

---

## 3. Overview of the TOGAF ADM Cycle

The Architecture Development Method consists of the following phases:

- Preliminary Phase – Establish architecture capability  
- Phase A – Architecture Vision  
- Phase B – Business Architecture  
- Phase C – Information Systems Architectures  
  (Data Architecture and Application Architecture)  
- Phase D – Technology Architecture  
- Phase E – Opportunities & Solutions  
- Phase F – Migration Planning  
- Phase G – Implementation Governance  
- Phase H – Architecture Change Management  

The ADM is **iterative**, with continuous feedback and refinement.

## 4. Phases and Typical Deliverables

### Preliminary Phase -- Establish Architecture Capability

**Purpose:**  
Set up the conditions for running an architecture programme.

**Typical activities:**
- Define scope and mandate.
- Establish governance and roles.
- Agree on principles.
- Set up repository and tools.

**Typical deliverables:**
- Architecture charter.
- Architecture principles.
- Governance structure.
- Architecture repository.

---

### Phase A -- Architecture Vision

**Purpose:**  
Define why the initiative exists and what success looks like.

**Typical activities:**
- Identify drivers and goals.
- Define scope and constraints.
- Identify stakeholders and concerns.
- Outline target vision.

**Typical deliverables:**
- Architecture Vision document.
- Stakeholder map.
- High-level requirements.
- Statement of architecture work.

---

### Phase B -- Business Architecture

**Purpose:**  
Understand and design the business context and processes.

**Typical activities:**
- Model baseline and target business processes.
- Identify roles and responsibilities.
- Analyse gaps.

**Typical deliverables:**
- Business process models.
- Business function and organisation models.
- Business requirements.
- Gap analysis.

---

### Phase C -- Information Systems Architectures

#### Data Architecture

**Purpose:**  
Define how information is structured, governed, and used.

**Typical deliverables:**
- Baseline and target data architecture.
- Conceptual and logical data models.
- Data principles and requirements.
- Data gap analysis.

#### Application Architecture

**Purpose:**  
Define how applications support the business and use the data.

**Typical deliverables:**
- Baseline and target application architecture.
- Application interaction diagrams.
- Interface and service definitions.
- Application gap analysis.

---

### Phase D -- Technology Architecture

**Purpose:**  
Define the infrastructure needed to support applications.

**Typical deliverables:**
- Baseline and target technology architecture.
- Platform and infrastructure models.
- Technology standards.
- Technology gap analysis.

---

### Phase E -- Opportunities & Solutions

**Purpose:**  
Identify solution options and major work packages.

**Typical activities:**
- Group changes into implementation projects.
- Define solution building blocks.

**Typical deliverables:**
- Solution concepts.
- Architecture roadmap (high level).
- Work package definitions.

---

### Phase F -- Migration Planning

**Purpose:**  
Plan how to move from baseline to target.

**Typical activities:**
- Prioritise projects.
- Define transition architectures.
- Assess risks.

**Typical deliverables:**
- Detailed migration roadmap.
- Implementation and migration plan.
- Risk and mitigation plan.

---

### Phase G -- Implementation Governance

**Purpose:**  
Ensure implementations conform to the architecture.

**Typical activities:**
- Architecture compliance reviews.
- Support projects during delivery.

**Typical deliverables:**
- Architecture contracts.
- Compliance assessments.
- Change requests.

---

### Phase H -- Architecture Change Management

**Purpose:**  
Manage evolution of the architecture over time.

**Typical activities:**
- Monitor drivers and change needs.
- Assess impact of changes.
- Trigger new ADM cycles.

**Typical deliverables:**
- Change management process.
- Updated architecture versions.
- Lessons learned.

---

## 5. Key Characteristics of the Approach

- Iterative and incremental.
- Strong stakeholder involvement.
- Clear separation of concerns.
- Emphasis on traceability and governance.
- Designed for long-lived, evolving architectures.

---

## 6. Discussion Points for Experts

This document is intended to support discussion on:

- Is TOGAF/ADM suitable for this type of initiative?
- Which phases are most critical?
- What level of formality is appropriate?
- How much governance is needed?
- What are typical pitfalls in similar efforts?
- How to balance rigor with agility?

---

## Summary

This initiative proposes to use the **TOGAF ADM** as a neutral, structured
framework to guide the design, implementation, and evolution of a complex
architecture across multiple stakeholders and domains.

Domain-specific concerns and solutions will be addressed only after agreement
on this common methodological foundation.
